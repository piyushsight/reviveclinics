                    <h4 class="text-center h-bold color ">How it Works</h4>
                    <p class="text-center h4"><strong>Stage One-Preparation</strong></p>
                    <p>As part of preparation process we gently clense your scalp to improve its heath and to enable hair system to apply perfectly. It ensures that the hair system achieves the perfect look and feel and also improves the longevity of hair system.</p>

                    <p class="text-center h4"><strong>Stage Two-Preparation</strong></p>
                    <p>We apply the hair system semi permanently to your scalp. To achieve this we use a water based and toxin free bond. It holds the hair system in place comfortable and strongly. This is a painless and gentle process. Our bonds are not harmful to the human health, as your ongoing skin and body health is our main priority</p>

                    <p class="text-center h4"><strong>Stage Three-The Look</strong></p>
                    <p>You can have virtually any hair style. Your hair system looks, behaves and feels exactly as if it was your own hair. You can sleep with it, shower with it, do sport with it and live normally. You are now a person with a full head of hair.</p>

                    <h4 class="col-sm-12 text-center h-bold color">How Our Hair System Works</h4>
                    <p>Our unique and revolutionary hair system is undetectable and the latest in hair loss solutions. It consists of human hair that has been implanted into a micro-thin layer of artificial skin. We then gently bond this artificial skin with the implanted hair onto your scalp. The whole procedure is pain free, non-surgical and takes less than 2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The Total Cover Plus hair system is designed to perfectly suit your life and not vice versa! You don't have to change a single aspect of your daily life because the hair system adapts to you. You can be confident and relaxed, whether it be in the shower, at the gym, outdoors or in the bedroom. The hair system becomes one with you, it becomes your hair.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="col-sm-12 text-center h-bold">Air Active Skin</h4>
                    <p>The heart of our hair system lies the brilliant artificial skin.</p>
                    <p>It is completely unique and not produced by any other company. The bio-engineered AirActive Skin is designed to imitate the epidermis, the top layer of the human skin. At an incredible 0.03mm it is micro thin and just as elastic and breathable as the epidermis. This allows the system to breath and sweat with you while sitting on your scalp. You don't get hot. You don't get itchy. You can't even feel it is there.</p>
                    <p>The artificial skin is so thin and light that it doesn't change you sensations at all. You're able to feel the touch of fingers on your scalp, right through the hair system. Another unique feature of its design is the transparent clearness of the skin. This means that it's not only impossible to feel the system, it's also completely invisible.</p>
                    <p>Our Air Active Skin will not only fool everybody else, it will even fool you! Like a contact lens, it is light, breathable and temporary. Our hair system gives you total freedom, just as if you had natural hair!</p>

                    <h4 class="h-light color marginbot-10">Bionic Hairline</h4>
                    <p>The front hairline of each Air Active Skin hair system is specifically designed to imitate a natural hairline.</p>
                    <p>With our Air Active Skin hair system we can give the appearance that your hair is gradually returning to its former density and hairline. We will simply give you a little bit more hair every time you get a new hair system. This was we achieve a natural look that other hair loss solutions after lack. By implementing thinner hairs randomly at the front of the system we create a hairline that perfectly imitates natural growth. Thanks to this and the invisible Air Active Skin our hair system is impossible to detect.</p>
                    <p>Because our Bionic Hairline looks so natural there are no limits to your hairstyle. You can sweep it back or to the side, wear it on top or long and wavy - it really is up to you!</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="h-light color marginbot-10">High Quality Hair</h4>
                    <p>We have three ways to guarantee that the hair of the AirActive Skin hair system keeps its natural and healthy look.</p>
                    <ol class='ol-margin'>
                        <li>We have the highest quality standards when it comes to selecting the hair we use for our systems.</li>
                        <li>We change your system on a regular basis in order to ensure that your hair always looks perfect.</li>
                    </ol> 

                    <h4 class="h-light color marginbot-10">Hair Regrowth Simulation</h4>
                    <p>If you're uncomfortable with the idea of going from very little or no hair to a full head of hair in a matter of hours then you don't have to worry.</p>
                    <p>Starting out with thinner, sparser hair, the structure changes as you move from the front to the top of the head. The same applies to hair length. We can simulate hair growth by giving you slightly longer hair overtim e you change your hair system.</p>
