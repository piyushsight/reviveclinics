                        <p>Hair transplantation is really about relocating (transplanting) the bald resistant hair follicles from the back of the head to the balding areas on the top of the head.</p> 
                        <p>This process works for a lifetime because the hair follicles taken from the back of the head are genetically resistant to baldness, regardless of where they are relocated to.</p>
                        <p class="h4"><strong>Will I be awake during a hair loss restoration procedure?</strong></p>
                        <p>Patients are completely awake and alert during hair surgery. The procedure involves the use of a mild local anesthetic, which allows the patient to watch television or sleep</p>
                        <p class="h4"><strong>Will my hair transplant results look completely natural?</strong></p>

                        <p>Hair transplantation, when done right, can be so natural that even your hair stylist will not know that you've had it done.</p> 
                        <p>But the skill and techniques of hair transplant surgeons does vary widely, as do their results. It's important to choose the right procedure and clinic to assure that you will get completely natural results.</p>
                        <p class="h4"><strong>Does the hair transplant procedure hurt?</strong></p>
                        <p>Patients are given local anesthesia in the donor and recipient areas. Most patients find that once the anesthesia is given that they feel no pain or discomfort during the surgery. Following surgery patients will typically feel some amount of soreness and numbness, with some mild discomfort. Most patients are pleasantly surprised by how minimal the discomfort from the surgical procedure is.</p>
                        <p class="h4"><strong>How many grafts/hairs will I need?</strong></p>
                        <p>The amount of grafts you will need ultimately depends on your degree of hair loss.</p>
                        <p class="h4"><strong>When will my newly transplanted hair start to grow?</strong></p>
                        <p>Normally it takes between three to eight months following surgery before the transplanted hair follicles begin to grow new hair. The transplanted hair grows in very thin initially and gradually grows thicker and fuller over time. After one year a patient's transplanted hair will be fully mature and will continue to grow for a life time.</p>
                        <p class="h4"><strong>Are the results permanent?</strong></p>
                        <p>Since the hair follicles that are transplanted to the balding areas are genetically resistant to going bald, they will continue to grow for a life time - just as if they had been left in the bald resistant donor area.</p>
